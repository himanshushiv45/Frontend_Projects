My Mother name is mrs.Renuka Shiv and she is a House wife.
Mother is the one who gives birth to us as well as takes care of us. This relationship of mother is given the highest 
respect in the world. This is the reason that most of the life-giving and honorable things in the world have been given the 
name of mother such as Mother India, Mother Earth, Mother Earth, Mother Nature, Mother Cow etc. Along with this, 
mother is also considered as the epitome of love and sacrifice. History is replete with descriptions of many such incidents.
Apart from nurturing us, mother also plays the role of guide and teacher in our life.
 Whatever initial knowledge and teachings we get in our life is given to us by our mother only. 
This is the reason why mother is also known as the first teacher.
