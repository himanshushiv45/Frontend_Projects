My Grand-Father name is  mr. Amratlal Shiv.
Grandfather's character is very important for the family. It is also said that it is necessary to have elders in the family.
 You must have seen in many places that without the elders, the family is heard. Where the advice of the elders is not listened to, 
there are daily battles in those homes. Old man gives good knowledge to every person. 
My grandfather loves me very much. As soon as I get free from school, I spend my time with Grandfather and play with Grandfather. 
I have formed afriendly relationship with my grandfather and both me and my grandfather are very happy with this relationship.
  He is a very proud person. When I was young, I was very attached to my grandfather. 
My father used to work in another city at that time. We often used to come to the village on holidays.
 He was a very honest person and worked very hard.
