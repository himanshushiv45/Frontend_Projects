<p><b>My Father name is mr.khemchand shiv and my father is carpenter. My father is the dearest father in the world. He is my true hero, my best friend, my inspiration and the best person I have ever seen.
 He is such a person who helps a lot in getting ready for school, getting out of bed in the morning and completing my homework well. 
He always takes care of me and calls my mother in the afternoon to know if I have reached home on my right time or not.
He always respects and pays attention to his parents i.e. my grandparents. I still remember when I was little, 
my grandparents usually used to talk about the bullies of 'my father' but they used to tell me that your father is a very good person 
in your life, be like him. It is 'my father' who wants to see everyone in the family happy.
